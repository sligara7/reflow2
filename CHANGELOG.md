# Changelog

Notable changes to Reflow 2.0. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
versions follow [semver](https://semver.org) — pre-1.0, so the minor number moves when the
graph model or the tool surface changes shape.

Two companion records, deliberately kept separate:

- **[docs/requirements-coverage.md](docs/requirements-coverage.md)** — *are we meeting the docs?*
  Every requirement → module → test, with an honest Met/Partial/Deferred status.
- **[docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md)** — *what should we do next?* Open work with its evidence
  and rough size.

This file is the third view: *what changed, and when*.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-18

The first release the design loop runs end to end on: a real project was designed and built
through it by an agent that had never seen the source, and by a second user on macOS via grok
build.

### Added

- **Interface layer** — `Interface` nodes with `PROVIDES`/`CONSUMES`, typed constructors, LLM
  extraction, MCP tools, and detection of contracts with a missing side
  (`unprovided_interface` / `unconsumed_interface`). Closes the failure the original Reflow never
  solved: a change made on one side of a service boundary leaving the other side stale.
  Pairing is keyed on node identity, so a shared name cannot mask a break.
- **Circular-dependency detection** — over a *directed* dependency view (`DEPENDS_ON` plus
  contracts collapsed through their `Interface`), reported per strongly-connected cluster rather
  than per elementary cycle. Critical, and propose-only: which edge to invert is a design
  decision.
- **As-built drift** (SP-6b) — an `Artifact.checksum` baseline and `reconcile_artifacts`, which
  compares caller-supplied observations and reports `missing_artifact` / `checksum_change` /
  `undocumented_addition` / `no_baseline`. Because `REALIZES` reads as Upstream, drift walks
  *back up* the golden thread to the Capability and Requirement behind the code. The core
  performs no I/O by design.
- **Write side for the types DETECT asks about** (WS-1..3) — `Verification` (+ `VERIFIES`,
  status), `Release`/`Environment`/`Resource` (+ `DEPLOYED_TO`, `REQUIRES_RESOURCE`), and
  `Decision` (+ `GOVERNED_BY`). Previously the system raised gaps demanding exactly these types
  and offered no typed way to answer them.
- **Gap review** — `acknowledge_gap` moves a judged gap into `reviewed_gaps` with the reason,
  stored as a real `Decision` so it outlives the session; `withdraw_gap_acknowledgement` puts it
  back. Reviews expire on their own when the situation changes, because a gap's id hashes its
  affected nodes.
- **`tools/reflow2_cli.py`** — one-shot command-line access to a graph, for shells, scripts and
  agents without an MCP connection.
- **`tools/smoke_mcp.py`** — end-to-end test of the shipped binary over stdio: the whole loop,
  plus persistence and cross-process determinism.
- **`docs/reflow-audit.md`** — every workflow and tool of the original Reflow, with an
  adopt / obsoleted / do-not-port verdict.
- **`where-am-i` skill** — read the graph back to the user in their own words. Added because a
  real user could not tell what the system had concluded.
- **`check-health` skill** — the HEAL step had MCP tools and no skill to invoke them, so eight
  defect categories were unreachable in practice.

### Fixed

- **Gap detection was not reproducible across processes.** `build_network` iterated a `HashSet`,
  whose hasher Rust seeds per process, so node insertion order — and with it Leiden's tie-breaks
  and every gap derived from community structure — differed between runs. Five runs on one
  unchanged graph gave 11, 12, 13 and 11 gaps. This silently undermined gap review: an accepted
  gap could return under a different id.
- **`unexpected_coupling` fired on every correctly-modelled contract.** An `Interface` joins its
  provider to its consumers and little else, so Leiden gave it a community of its own and each
  `PROVIDES` edge read as a "sole bridge" — the modelling discipline penalising itself.
  Contracts are now collapsed to the components they couple.
- **Community fragments were treated as parts of the design.** Both endpoints of a bridge must
  now sit in a community of ≥3 — the same non-trivial test `single_point_of_failure` already
  used.
- **`Fragment` and `DriftEvent` sat inside the topology** they were never part of, shifting
  communities and, for `DriftEvent`, eligible to be reported as a coupling in its own right.
- **`link_artifact` guidance was misleading** — it told the agent to confirm the
  `unrealized_capability` gap had closed, when the first `link_artifact` *switches that detector
  on* for every other capability, so the total rises. Correct behaviour, wrong instruction.

### Changed

- `detect_gaps` now returns **open** gaps only; reviewed ones move to `reviewed_gaps`. The open
  list is meant to mean *still needs attention* — a list that can never reach zero gets skimmed.
- The MCP surface grew from 34 to 52 tools.
- `getting-started/SETUP.md` gained a kickoff line and a stop/resume section, and states the
  one-agent-at-a-time constraint with the exact error text.

### Known limits

Recorded honestly rather than omitted; see [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md) for the full list.

- **No schema discovery.** An agent needing an edge type has to guess; the blind trial
  brute-forced fourteen before settling on one *because it validated*.
- **`ingest` is not reachable over MCP** (SP-3b), so the multi-pass extraction pipeline — and
  with it provenance, fuzzy dedup and time-aware resolution — does not run in agent-native use.
- **`gap_to_prompt` output is not persisted**, so a question asked in one session is re-derived
  and re-asked in the next.
- **Component hierarchy cannot be built from the surface** — `contain_component` exists in core
  and is not an MCP tool.
- **`single_point_of_failure` responds to graph shape more than to risk** — the blind trial saw
  15 defects fall to 0 after adding two bookkeeping edges.
- Multi-project graph selection, concurrent multi-agent access, `EnvironmentRule`/`QualityGate`,
  and generative HEAL content all remain deliberate deferrals.

## [0.0.1] — before 2026-07-18

Initial core: the schema (26 node types / 52 edge types), `DesignGraph`, the coherence loop
(CHANGE / PROPAGATE / DETECT / HEAL), the temporal axis, INGEST, GENESIS, artifact linking, the
graph-analysis modules, and the `reflow2-mcp` server. See
[docs/requirements-coverage.md](docs/requirements-coverage.md) for what that covered.
