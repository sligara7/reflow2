# Reflow Redesign — "Design Anything, Build Anything"

A clean-room rebuild of Reflow's core idea
([github.com/sligara7/reflow2](https://github.com/sligara7/reflow2)), starting fresh so
nothing in the source projects is disturbed — all of them the author's own work:
[reflow](https://github.com/sligara7/reflow),
[storyflow](https://github.com/sligara7/storyflow),
[chain_reflow](https://github.com/sligara7/chain_reflow), and
[dynograph-foundation](https://github.com/sligara7/dynograph-foundation).

**New here? Read [docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md) first** — it maps all the documents
and how they fit together.

## Vision

Capture the **entire lifecycle — concept → operations — in one graph**, tied together by
the systems-engineering *golden thread*. When anything changes in any phase, the ripple
effects are **automatically detected, surfaced to the user as plain questions, and healed**
back to coherence — so concept through operations always stays in agreement. The user
never needs to know systems engineering; the graph does. See
[docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md) — it's the north star for everything below.

The engine is the **coherence loop**: `CHANGE → PROPAGATE → DETECT → SURFACE → HEAL →
COHERENCE` — where PROPAGATE walks the golden thread to find a change's blast radius
([docs/impact-propagation.md](docs/impact-propagation.md)).

## What this is

A graph-backed workflow engine that partners with an LLM agent to **design and
build anything** — not just software. It keeps Reflow's phase spine
(**WHAT → WHERE → BUILD → VERIFY → OPERATE**) but swaps two foundations:

1. **Store**: `dynograph-foundation` (schema-driven Rust graph engine:
   RocksDB + HNSW vectors + BM25 text + fuzzy/vector entity resolution)
   replaces Neo4j.
2. **Design capture**: instead of hand-calling CRUD tools, freeform design
   input is **extracted** into the graph via the storyflow / `dynograph-extract`
   pattern — schema-driven, phase-aware, multi-pass, with graph-informed
   dedup.

## The design vocabulary

Domain-neutral node types, layered by the phase they feed (26 types across 10 schema
domains; see [docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md) and `../tools/validate_schema.py`):

| Phase / layer | Nodes |
|-------|-------|
| P0 · Intent | `Project`, `Requirement`, `Constraint`, `DesignRule` |
| P1 · Function (WHAT) | `Capability`, `Flow`, `Actor` |
| P2 · Structure (WHERE) | `Component`, `Interface`, `Decision`, `Anchor` |
| P3 · Realization (BUILD) | `Artifact`, `Fragment` |
| P4 · Verification | `Verification`, `QualityGate`, `DriftEvent` |
| P5 · Operation | `Release`, `Environment`, `Resource` |
| Operating environment | `EnvironmentRule` |
| Axis Z · change over time | `DesignEpoch`, `TemporalFact`, `Snapshot`, `ChangeEvent` |
| Cross-cutting | `DimensionAssessment`, `DimensionObservation` |

**Structural edges:** CONTAINS, PROVIDES, CONSUMES, ALLOCATED_TO, REALIZES,
VERIFIES, DEPENDS_ON, SATISFIES, PART_OF_FLOW, DEPLOYED_TO, REQUIRES_RESOURCE,
GOVERNED_BY.

**Inference ("why") edges** (wildcard endpoints): CAUSES, ENABLES, BLOCKS,
TRIGGERS, CONTRADICTS, VALIDATES, VIOLATES, RISKS, MITIGATES, EVOLVES_INTO,
OBSOLETES, DUPLICATES, CONSTRAINS, ANTICIPATES, MASKS.

```

## Three structural axes

Beyond phases and processes, every design is sliced along three independent axes
([docs/three-axes.md](docs/three-axes.md)):

- **X — who relates to whom**: the horizontal network of entities + typed/inference edges
- **Y — how it's built**: the vertical decomposition spine (Project ▸ Component ▸ Capability ▸ Artifact)
- **Z — how it changes**: the time axis — epochs, time-bounded facts, snapshots, change events ([schema/temporal.yaml](schema/temporal.yaml))

## Phases and processes

Reflow's **phases** (P0–P5) are the *linear lifecycle spine* — where a project is.
Storyflow contributes six *universal graph processes* — the *cyclic engine* that runs
on the graph regardless of phase. They map onto the coherence loop; see
[docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md) for the full reconciliation.

- **GENESIS** — bootstrap the graph from a brief *(acknowledged; not yet detailed)*
- **INGEST** — extraction ([docs/extraction-plan.md](docs/extraction-plan.md))
- **DIAGNOSE → PROMPT** — find graph weaknesses & ask the user questions ([docs/gap-surfacing.md](docs/gap-surfacing.md))
- **SYNTHESIZE** — graph → artifacts (docs, diagrams, as-built) *(acknowledged; not yet detailed)*
- **HEAL** — detect & repair structural defects ([docs/heal-process.md](docs/heal-process.md))
- *(reflow2 addition)* **PROPAGATE** — ripple a change along the golden thread ([docs/impact-propagation.md](docs/impact-propagation.md))

## Status

Bootstrapping. Schema-first: the node/edge vocabulary is the foundation
everything else builds on.
