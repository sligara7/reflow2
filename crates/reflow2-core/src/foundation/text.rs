//! Domain-neutral full-text / BM25 index primitive for dynograph.
//!
//! Wraps an embedded [Tantivy] inverted index behind a small, storage-agnostic
//! API: index a node's full-text fields ([`TextIndex::upsert`]), remove it
//! ([`TextIndex::delete`]), and run tokenized, BM25-ranked keyword search over
//! it ([`TextIndex::search`]). The crate knows nothing about schemas, graphs as
//! a concept, or any consumer domain — callers pass already-extracted `(graph,
//! node_type, node_id, fields)` and get back scored `node_id`s.
//!
//! # Consistency model
//!
//! Tantivy has its own commit lifecycle and cannot join RocksDB's atomic write
//! batch, so this index is a **derived, rebuildable** view: the caller's primary
//! store is the source of truth. Writes ([`upsert`]/[`delete`]) are buffered and
//! only become visible to [`search`] after an explicit [`commit`]. This matches
//! Tantivy's design (commits are comparatively expensive) and lets callers batch.
