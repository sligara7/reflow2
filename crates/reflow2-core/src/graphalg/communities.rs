//! Community detection via the **Leiden** method (modularity maximization),
//! treating the graph as **undirected**.
//!
//! Leiden (Traag, Waltman & van Eck, 2019) is the successor to Louvain (Blondel
//! et al., 2008): same modularity objective, but it repairs Louvain's one real
//! defect — communities that come out *badly connected*, or even internally
//! *disconnected*. Where connected components answer "what's reachable" and
//! clustering answers "how cliquey is a node," Leiden answers "what are the
//! dense sub-communities *within* a connected graph" — the faction/cluster
//! discovery primitive. It greedily maximizes **modularity**
//!
//! ```text
//! Q = (1/2m) Σ_uv [A_uv - γ k_u k_v / 2m] δ(c_u, c_v)
//! ```
//!
//! where `m` is total edge weight, `k_u` the weighted degree, `γ` the
//! resolution (1.0 = classic modularity; higher → more, smaller communities),
//! and `δ` is 1 when `u`,`v` share a community. Edge weights are **strengths**
//! (higher = tighter tie), like PageRank/eigenvector.
//!
//! Three phases repeat until the partition stops changing:
//! 1. **Local moving** — each node, in index order, leaves its community and
//!    joins the neighboring community giving the largest modularity gain (or
//!    stays). Repeat until a full pass moves nothing. (This is Louvain's inner
//!    loop, seeded from the previous level's partition `P`.)
//! 2. **Refinement** — starting from *singletons*, and never crossing a `P`
//!    community boundary, merge each node into a *well-connected* sub-community.
//!    A node is only eligible to move if it is itself well-connected to its `P`
//!    community, and it may only join a sub-community that is well-connected to
//!    that community. The result `P_refined` **subdivides** `P`, and every one
//!    of its parts is internally connected — this is the step Louvain lacks and
//!    the reason Leiden never emits a disconnected community.
//! 3. **Aggregation** — collapse each *refined* sub-community into one super-node
//!    (intra weight becomes a self-loop, inter weight becomes a super-edge), but
//!    seed the next level's community assignment from `P` (each refined part sits
//!    inside exactly one `P` community). Recurse. Aggregating at the finer
//!    `P_refined` granularity — while still grouping by `P` — is what carries the
//!    connectivity guarantee up the levels.
//!
//! **Determinism.** The reference Leiden randomizes the refinement move (picking
//! among quality-preserving targets by a Boltzmann weight) to escape local
//! optima. We deliberately run the **deterministic greedy** variant instead:
//! nodes are processed in ascending index order, each takes the strictly-best
//! well-connected target, gain ties break toward the smallest community index,
//! and communities are renumbered by ascending representative. The connectivity
//! guarantee comes from the refinement *structure* (eligible-node and
//! well-connected-target predicates), **not** from the randomness, so dropping
//! the randomness costs only the occasional escape from a local optimum — not
//! the guarantee. With the builder's already-sorted adjacency the result is
//! fully reproducible, matching the no-randomized-restarts posture of the
//! power-iteration centralities (consumer graphs are small, so the exact greedy
//! pass is affordable and stable).
